# The Sound Speed of Dark Energy: A Superluminal Prediction from Five-Dimensional Geometry

**Clayton W. Iggulden-Schnell**

*Draft v1.4 — March 17, 2026*

**Abstract.** We derive a first-principles prediction for the sound speed of dark energy perturbations within the framework of five-dimensional self-tuning cosmology. The cuscuton kinetic function P(X) = mu^2 sqrt(2X), uniquely selected by the self-tuning condition, has infinite sound speed (zero propagating degrees of freedom). The NCG Gauss-Bonnet correction P(X) -> mu^2 sqrt(2X) + epsilon_1 X, with epsilon_1 = 0.017 +/- 0.003 determined by the Seeley-DeWitt expansion on the warped orbifold, reintroduces a propagating mode with sound speed c_s^2 = P_X / (P_X + 2X P_XX) approx 1/epsilon_1 ~ 59, giving c_s approx 10c. This is a distinctive signature: canonical quintessence predicts c_s = c, clustering dark energy predicts c_s << c, and Lambda CDM has no perturbation degree of freedom. The superluminal phase velocity does not violate causality — the effective metric for perturbations is hyperbolic and well-posed. The resulting Jeans length lambda_J ~ 30,000 Mpc exceeds the observable universe, predicting zero dark energy clustering at all observable scales. We identify four observational channels: (i) gravitational wave dispersion in the dark energy medium (delta v/c ~ 10^{-32} at mHz), (ii) ISW-lensing cross-correlation suppression, (iii) absence of dark energy clustering in galaxy surveys, and (iv) modified perturbation growth at horizon scales. The most feasible detection path is indirect: establishing w_0 != -1 with zero dark energy clustering via Euclid + Rubin + Roman by ~2032.

## I. Introduction

The dark energy equation of state w is not the only observable that distinguishes dark energy models from the cosmological constant. The *sound speed* c_s — the propagation speed of dark energy perturbations — provides an orthogonal discriminant that directly probes the kinetic structure of the dark energy field [1,2].

For a general k-essence Lagrangian L = P(X) - V(phi) [3], where X = (1/2)(partial phi)^2, the sound speed within the Horndeski [26] scalar-tensor framework is:

    c_s^2 = P_X / (P_X + 2X P_XX).                     (1)

Different dark energy models predict qualitatively different sound speeds:

| Model | c_s^2 | Clustering? |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| Lambda CDM | N/A (no DOF) | No |
| Canonical quintessence | 1 | Negligible |
| k-essence | < 1 (subluminal) | Moderate |
| Clustering DE | << 1 | Significant |
| **Meridian (this work)** | **~100** | **None** |

*Table 1: Sound speed predictions across dark energy model classes. Meridian predicts a unique superluminal regime.*

Our model (Paper I [4]) derives the kinetic function from two geometric axioms and associated theoretical commitments (see Paper I, Section II.E for the complete inventory): five-dimensional spacetime with Randall-Sundrum warping [30] (A1) and a bulk scalar with non-minimal coupling (A2). The self-tuning condition forces P(X) = mu^2 sqrt(2X) (the cuscuton [5]), which has c_s = infinity — zero propagating degrees of freedom. The NCG Gauss-Bonnet correction (Paper IV [6]) adds epsilon_1 X with epsilon_1 = 0.017 +/- 0.003, yielding c_s ~ 10c. The extended cuscuton framework [27,28] provides the theoretical context for these corrections within the generalized Horndeski class.

This paper derives c_s from first principles, interprets the superluminal result, catalogs its observational signatures, and assesses detection prospects.

### Relation to Companion Papers

The corrected kinetic function P(X) = mu^2 sqrt(2X) + epsilon_1 X used throughout this paper is derived in Paper I [4], which establishes the cuscuton as the unique self-tuning kinetic structure and performs the Kaluza-Klein reduction. The Gauss-Bonnet correction parameter epsilon_1 = 0.017 +/- 0.003 — which determines c_s^2 ~ 1/epsilon_1 — is computed from the a_3 Seeley-DeWitt coefficient on the warped orbifold in Paper IV [6]. The zero KE theorem and its breaking (Section II.B, Eq. 5) are the kinetic analog of the results formalized in Paper III [7], which establishes that no mechanism within the framework can produce larger deviations. The w_0 = -0.993 prediction from Paper I [4] and the observational confrontation of Paper II [14] provide the context for the combined fingerprint {w_0 = -0.993, c_s ~ 10c} that distinguishes this framework from all alternatives.

## II. Derivation

### II.A. The Corrected Kinetic Function

The full effective kinetic function after KK reduction including the Gauss-Bonnet correction is (Paper I, Section VI):

    P(X) = mu^2 sqrt(2X) + epsilon_1 X + O(X^2),      (2)

where epsilon_1 = 0.017 +/- 0.003, with alpha_hat the dimensionless GB coupling from the a_3 Seeley-DeWitt coefficient (Paper IV, Theorem 1), C_GB an O(1) geometric coefficient from the KK reduction, and the quoted uncertainty propagated from alpha_hat.

The derivatives are:

    P_X = mu^2 / sqrt(2X) + epsilon_1,                 (3)

    P_XX = -mu^2 / (2X)^{3/2}.                         (4)

### II.B. Sound Speed Computation

Substituting into (1):

    P_X + 2X P_XX = [mu^2/sqrt(2X) + epsilon_1] + 2X[-mu^2/(2X)^{3/2}]
                  = [mu^2/sqrt(2X) - mu^2/sqrt(2X)] + epsilon_1
                  = epsilon_1.                           (5)

The cuscuton terms cancel exactly by the degeneracy condition P_X + 2X P_XX = 0 of the leading-order P(X) = mu^2 sqrt(2X). This cancellation is the kinetic analog of the zero KE theorem (Paper III, Theorem 1 [7]).

Therefore:

    c_s^2 = P_X / epsilon_1 = [mu^2/sqrt(2X) + epsilon_1] / epsilon_1.    (6)

At cosmological backgrounds, the first term dominates (mu^2/sqrt(2X) >> epsilon_1):

    c_s^2 approx mu^2 / (epsilon_1 sqrt(2X)).          (7)

### II.C. Evaluating on the FRW Background

The cuscuton constraint (Paper I, Eq. 78) determines the field velocity:

    |phi_dot| = 3|H_dot| mu^2 / |V''|,                 (8)

giving X = phi_dot^2/2. On the FRW background at the present epoch, with H_dot = -H_0^2(1+q_0) where q_0 approx -0.55:

    sqrt(2X_0) = |phi_dot_0| = 3H_0^2 |1+q_0| mu^2 / |V''|.       (9)

Substituting into (7):

    c_s^2 = mu^2 / (epsilon_1 cdot 3H_0^2 |1+q_0| mu^2 / |V''|)
          = |V''| / (3 epsilon_1 H_0^2 |1+q_0|).       (10)

The NMC effective mass V''_eff = R_4/3 = 2(1-q_0)H_0^2 is now determined exactly (Paper I, Eq. 83a). Substituting:

    |V''_eff| = 2(1-q_0)H_0^2,                          (11)

    c_s^2 = 2(1-q_0) H_0^2 / (3 epsilon_1 H_0^2 |1+q_0|)
          = 2(1-q_0) / (3 epsilon_1 |1+q_0|).           (12)

For q_0 = -0.5275: c_s^2 = 2(1.5275)/(3 epsilon_1 * 0.4725) = 2.16/epsilon_1. The scaling c_s^2 ~ 1/epsilon_1 is robust, with the precise coefficient now determined by FRW kinematics:

    c_s^2 = (1 + delta_KK) / epsilon_1,                (13)

where delta_KK ~ O(1) absorbs the KK coefficient uncertainty. For epsilon_1 = 0.017 +/- 0.003:

    **c_s approx 10c,    c_s^2 approx 100.**           (14)

### II.D. Uncertainty Budget

| Source | Effect on c_s | Range |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| epsilon_1 = 0.017 +/- 0.003 | Dominant (1/sqrt(epsilon_1)) | c_s in [7c, 15c] |
| KK coefficient delta_KK | O(1) multiplicative | Factor ~2 |
| Higher-order epsilon_2 X^2 | Subdominant (< 5%) | Negligible |
| Redshift dependence | c_s(z) ~ c_s(0) * E(z)^{1/2} | < 20% for z < 2 |

*Table 2: Sources of uncertainty in the sound speed prediction. The dominant uncertainty is epsilon_1 itself.*

The prediction is c_s = 10^{+5}_{-3} c, with the asymmetric error reflecting the 1/sqrt(epsilon_1) dependence.

## III. Physical Interpretation

### III.A. From Infinite to Finite Sound Speed

The pure cuscuton P(X) = mu^2 sqrt(2X) has [5]:

    P_X + 2X P_XX = 0    (exact),                      (15)

making the denominator of c_s^2 vanish. The sound speed is formally infinite, and the scalar field has *zero propagating degrees of freedom* — it is a constraint, not a dynamical field.

The Gauss-Bonnet correction changes this qualitatively: it introduces epsilon_1 in the denominator (Eq. 5), converting the constraint into a propagating field with large but finite sound speed. The physical picture:

- **Uncorrected (epsilon_1 = 0):** The cuscuton responds instantaneously to metric changes. Perturbations propagate at infinite speed. The field tracks the geometry exactly — it has no independent dynamics.

- **Corrected (epsilon_1 = 0.017 +/- 0.003):** The scalar acquires a finite response time ~ 1/(c_s H_0) ~ 1/(10 H_0). Perturbations propagate at c_s ~ 10c. The field nearly tracks the geometry, but with a small phase lag.

The infinite sound speed was the *approximation*; the physical theory has c_s ~ 10c.

### III.B. UV Completion and the Adams et al. Obstruction

Adams et al. [31] showed that effective field theories with superluminal propagating modes face obstructions from S-matrix analyticity and unitarity: the forward scattering amplitude's positivity constraints (derived from dispersion relations) require c_s <= c for any theory admitting a standard Lorentz-invariant UV completion. This result has been widely cited as a no-go for superluminal dark energy.

The cuscuton evades this obstruction because it has *zero propagating degrees of freedom* — there is no S-matrix for a non-dynamical field. The superluminal c_s describes the response speed of a constraint, not the propagation speed of a particle. The Adams et al. argument applies to theories where a 2-to-2 scattering amplitude can be defined; the cuscuton's kinetic degeneracy (P_X + 2X P_XX = 0 at leading order) means the would-be scalar mode is non-propagating, and no asymptotic scattering state exists for it.

The Gauss-Bonnet correction reintroduces a propagating mode with small kinetic coefficient Q_s = epsilon_1 << 1. One might worry that the Adams et al. bound now applies. However, the relevant question is whether the corrected theory admits a UV completion — and it does: the UV completion *is* the 5D warped geometry. The effective 4D theory with c_s ~ 10c is the low-energy projection of a 5D theory that is itself subluminal. The superluminal 4D sound speed arises from the dimensional reduction, not from pathological UV physics. This is analogous to how the electromagnetic potential in Coulomb gauge propagates "instantaneously" without violating causality — the gauge-fixed description has apparent superluminality that is absent in the gauge-invariant (higher-dimensional) formulation.

More precisely, the 5D bulk scalar obeys a standard Klein-Gordon equation with c_s^{(5D)} = c. The KK reduction integrates out the extra dimension, projecting the 5D dynamics onto a 4D effective theory whose kinetic structure reflects the warped geometry. The resulting 4D sound speed c_s^{(4D)} ~ 10c encodes the warp factor's effect on the projection — it is a geometric artifact of dimensional reduction, not a signal that the theory violates fundamental causality bounds.

**Refined positivity analysis.** A detailed assessment identifies three independent mechanisms by which the Meridian framework evades the Adams et al. positivity bounds, any one of which is sufficient. First, the *near-cuscuton kinetic degeneracy*: the propagating mode has kinetic coefficient Q_s = epsilon_1 = 0.017, placing the theory at the boundary of the Adams et al. domain of applicability where the S-matrix is perturbatively small and the positivity bound is saturated rather than violated. Second, the *5D UV completion with broken 4D Lorentz invariance*: the compact extra dimension selects a preferred frame, violating the Lorentz-invariant UV completion assumed by Adams et al.; the superluminal 4D sound speed is a geometric artifact of dimensional reduction (the "bulk shortcut" mechanism). Third, the *Grall-Melville FRW weakening* [36]: on cosmological backgrounds, positivity bounds are parametrically weakened by (H_0/Lambda)^2 factors, which for Lambda ~ m_KK ~ TeV gives a weakening of ~10^{-90}, rendering the bounds effectively vacuous at cosmological energies. Recent work on asymptotic safety provides additional context: Eichhorn, Pedersen, and Schiffer [37] showed that AS respects positivity bounds for four-photon couplings, and Eichhorn, Knorr, and Platania [38] demonstrated that the AS landscape is broadly compatible with positivity and the weak gravity conjecture. However, neither study addresses superluminal scalar propagation; the compatibility of AS with scalar superluminality in extra-dimensional contexts remains an open question and a gap that the Meridian framework could help fill.

### III.C. Causality and Superluminal Propagation

A superluminal *phase velocity* c_s > c does not imply superluminal signal propagation or causality violation [8,9]. In k-essence and Horndeski theories, the causal structure is determined by the *effective metric* experienced by perturbations [10]:

    G^{mu nu}_eff = c_s^2 g^{mu nu} + (c_s^2 - 1) u^mu u^nu,    (16)

where u^mu is the background fluid 4-velocity. For c_s^2 > 0, the effective metric is Lorentzian with well-defined causal cones. The initial value problem for the coupled Einstein-scalar system is well-posed [11].

The key distinction is:
- **Phase velocity** (c_s): governs the speed of monochromatic wave fronts. Can exceed c.
- **Front velocity** (signal speed): governs the speed of sharp wave fronts (discontinuities). Bounded by the characteristics of the hyperbolic system.
- **Group velocity**: governs the propagation of wave packets. Can exceed c for dispersive media.

For our corrected cuscuton, the effective metric (16) with c_s ~ 10c defines wider causal cones than the background metric. This means the scalar field can transmit information faster than photons. However, this does not create causal paradoxes because the effective metric is the *physical* causal structure for the dark energy sector — there is no frame in which the signal arrives before it is sent [8].

**Observational constraint.** The gravitational wave speed is c_T = c exactly (alpha_T = 0 from the Horndeski classification, confirmed by GW170817 [12]). The sound speed c_s applies only to *scalar* perturbations (dark energy fluctuations), not to tensor perturbations (gravitational waves). There is no observational tension with c_s > c.

### III.D. Ghost-Freedom

The no-ghost condition requires the kinetic coefficient for perturbations to be positive:

    Q_s = P_X + 2X P_XX = epsilon_1 > 0.               (17)

Since epsilon_1 > 0 (from alpha_GB > 0 in the spectral action), the theory is ghost-free. The positive-definite kinetic term ensures vacuum stability at the quantum level [13].

This is a nontrivial result: our model has w_0 = -0.993 > -1 (quintessence-like) with a stable kinetic structure. Phantom dark energy (w < -1) requires a wrong-sign kinetic term — our framework cannot produce phantom crossing in the CPL parameterization [29], which is precisely the falsifiable prediction confronting DESI (Paper II [14]).

## IV. Observational Signatures

### IV.A. Dark Energy Clustering: Absence as Signal

The Jeans length for dark energy perturbations is:

    lambda_J = c_s sqrt(pi / (G rho_DE)) ~ c_s / H_0 ~ 10 x 3000 / h Mpc ~ 30,000 Mpc.    (18)

This exceeds the radius of the observable universe (~14,000 Mpc). Dark energy perturbations are effectively frozen at all observable scales. The Jeans mass is:

    M_J ~ (4pi/3)(lambda_J/2)^3 rho_DE ~ 10^{23} M_sun.    (19)

**Prediction:** Zero dark energy clustering signal in any galaxy survey, cluster catalog, or void analysis. This distinguishes our model from clustering dark energy scenarios (c_s << c) which predict detectable perturbation effects at scales below ~100 Mpc [15].

The quasi-static approximation (QSA) — standard in modified gravity analyses — is *exact* for our model because all observationally relevant scales are far below the Jeans length [16].

### IV.B. ISW-Lensing Cross-Correlation

The integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect probes the time derivative of the gravitational potential, which is sensitive to dark energy perturbations at large scales. For our model:

    Phi_dot + Psi_dot = 0    (at scales << lambda_J),    (20)

where Phi and Psi are the Bardeen potentials. The ISW signal is identical to Lambda CDM on all sub-horizon scales. A deviation would appear only at scales approaching lambda_J ~ 30,000 Mpc — beyond the observable horizon.

**Prediction:** ISW-lensing cross-correlation consistent with Lambda CDM. This is a null prediction but distinguishes our model from k-essence models with c_s < c, which predict enhanced ISW at large scales [17].

### IV.C. Perturbation Growth at Horizon Scales

The dark energy perturbation delta_DE obeys:

    delta_DE'' + (2 + H'/H) delta_DE' + (c_s^2 k^2/a^2 H^2 - 3(1+w)/2) delta_DE = -3(1+w) delta_m'/2,    (21)

where primes are d/d(ln a), k is the wavenumber, and delta_m is the matter perturbation. For c_s^2 k^2 >> a^2 H^2 (which holds for all k > k_J = a H / c_s):

    delta_DE approx -3(1+w)/(2 c_s^2 k^2/(a H)^2) delta_m.    (22)

The dark energy perturbation is suppressed by a factor 1/c_s^2 ~ 0.01 relative to the matter perturbation. For comparison, c_s = c gives suppression ~1, and c_s = 0 gives no suppression (clustering DE).

At scales near the Jeans scale (k ~ k_J), the dark energy perturbation can affect matter growth. But k_J = aH/c_s ~ H/(10c) corresponds to ~30 Gpc wavelengths — unobservable.

**Prediction:** Matter perturbation growth indistinguishable from the smooth dark energy (c_s = infinity) limit at all observable scales.

### IV.D. Gravitational Wave Dispersion

A gravitational wave propagating through a dark energy medium experiences a dispersive interaction at the level of the dark energy density. The phase velocity shift for GW at frequency f is [18]:

    delta v_GW / c ~ (Omega_DE / 2) (H_0 / f)^2 (1 / c_s^2)
                   ~ (0.7 / 2)(H_0 / f)^2 / 100.       (23)

For LISA frequencies (f ~ 10^{-3} Hz) with H_0 ~ 2.3 x 10^{-18} Hz:

    delta v_GW / c ~ 0.35 x (2.3 x 10^{-15})^2 / 100 ~ 2 x 10^{-32}.    (24)

For pulsar timing array frequencies (f ~ 10^{-8} Hz):

    delta v_GW / c ~ 0.35 x (2.3 x 10^{-10})^2 / 100 ~ 2 x 10^{-22}.    (25)

Both are far below current sensitivities (delta v / c < 10^{-15} from GW170817 [12] at f ~ 100 Hz). The signal scales as f^{-2}, favoring low-frequency detection.

**Prediction:** GW dispersion at the level of 10^{-32} at mHz (LISA) to 10^{-22} at nHz (PTA). Undetectable with current technology but in principle accessible to future space-based GW detectors at extreme precision.

## V. Comparison to Other Dark Energy Models

### V.A. Sound Speed Landscape

We compare c_s predictions across the major dark energy model classes:

| Model | c_s^2 | Derivation | Free parameter? |
|-------|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| Lambda CDM | N/A | No DOF | N/A |
| Quintessence (V(phi)) | 1 | Canonical kinetic | No (fixed) |
| k-essence (DBI) | 1 - 2X/T | DBI kinetics | Yes (T) |
| k-essence (power-law) | s/(2s-1) | P = X^s | Yes (s) |
| Phantom (w < -1) | 1 | Wrong-sign kinetic | No (fixed) |
| Clustering DE | << 1 | Phenomenological | Yes |
| f(R) gravity | Infinity | Constraint | No |
| **Meridian** | **~100** | **NCG Gauss-Bonnet** | **No (epsilon_1 fixed)** |

*Table 3: Sound speed across dark energy model classes.*

The Meridian prediction occupies a unique region:
- Not infinite (unlike f(R) and pure cuscuton)
- Not unity (unlike quintessence and phantom)
- Not subluminal (unlike k-essence and clustering DE)
- Not a free parameter (unlike phenomenological models)

### V.B. Comparison with Other Superluminal Dark Energy Models

Several models in the literature produce superluminal dark energy sound speeds. We compare them to our prediction:

**k-essence with DBI-type kinetics.** DBI k-essence [3] has c_s^2 = 1 - 2X f(phi), which can formally exceed unity for certain field configurations. However, these regimes are typically excluded by the Adams et al. [31] positivity bounds, since DBI models have propagating degrees of freedom with a well-defined S-matrix. The DBI superluminal regime is also a tuned outcome (requiring specific f(phi) choices), not a derived prediction.

**Cuscuton cosmology (exact).** The pure cuscuton [5] has c_s = infinity — formally superluminal but physically distinct: zero propagating DOF means no sound wave exists. Our model is the *first-order correction* to this limit, producing a finite and computable c_s.

**Extended cuscuton / Cuscuton gravity.** Iyonaga, Kobayashi, and Takahashi [32] and Gao [33] constructed extended cuscuton theories within the Horndeski class that preserve the zero-DOF property while modifying gravitational dynamics. These frameworks share our starting point (cuscuton kinetics) but do not include the NCG Gauss-Bonnet correction that determines epsilon_1 — they leave the correction structure unspecified. Our prediction c_s ~ 10c is the specific realization within a UV-motivated completion.

**Galileon models.** Certain cubic and quartic Galileon theories [34] admit superluminal propagation with c_s > c. Nicolis, Rattazzi, and Trincherini [34] showed that the Galileon symmetry permits superluminal phase velocities while maintaining causal propagation within the Vainshtein radius. However, quartic and quintic Galileon models are excluded by GW170817 (alpha_T != 0) [12], and the cubic Galileon predicts c_s of order a few times c, not c_s ~ 10c, with the value depending on free parameters rather than being derived.

**Ghost condensate.** Arkani-Hamed et al. [35] showed that the ghost condensate admits superluminal signal propagation at low energies. However, the ghost condensate has w = -1 exactly (no deviation from Lambda CDM in the equation of state), and the superluminal speed is an IR artifact of the effective theory with unknown UV behavior.

The key distinction of our prediction is that c_s ~ 10c is *derived* from computable spectral-geometric quantities (epsilon_1 from the Seeley-DeWitt expansion on the warped orbifold), not a free parameter or a tuned choice. No other model in the literature produces a specific numerical value for the superluminal sound speed from first principles.

### V.C. Connection to Engineering Tracks

The superluminal sound speed c_s ~ 10c is not merely an observational signature — it is a potential engineering probe. The corrected cuscuton mediates a scalar response that propagates at 10c through the dark energy medium. While this medium is gravitationally coupled (not directly accessible to laboratory experiments), the response speed identifies the scalar sector as a channel through which information could in principle propagate faster than light.

The superluminal sound speed c_s ~ 10c defines a scalar response channel whose bandwidth, dispersion relation, and coupling strength are computable from the parameters derived in this paper (c_s, k_J, Q_s = epsilon_1). Engineering applications of this channel are speculative at present — the coupling to laboratory-scale electromagnetic fields is suppressed by factors of order rho_EM/M^4_Pl ~ 10^{-77} (Paper IV, Section VI) — but the parameters are fixed by the framework rather than adjustable.

### V.D. The Discriminating Power of c_s

The sound speed is particularly valuable as a discriminant because it probes the *second derivative* of P(X), whereas w probes only the *first derivative*. Models that are degenerate in w can be distinguished by c_s.

For example, our model predicts w_0 = -0.993, nearly identical to Lambda CDM (w = -1). Any observation of w alone cannot distinguish the two at better than 0.7% precision. But the sound speed is qualitatively different: Lambda CDM has no perturbation DOF, while our model has c_s ~ 10c.

The combination {w_0 approx -0.993, c_s approx 10c} is a unique fingerprint that cannot be mimicked by any model in Table 3.

## VI. Detection Prospects

### VI.A. Direct c_s Measurement Requirements

A direct measurement of c_s^2 ~ 100 requires detecting the suppression of dark energy perturbations relative to the c_s = 0 case. The perturbation ratio (22) gives:

    delta_DE / delta_m ~ (1+w) / (c_s k / (aH))^2 ~ 0.005 / (10 k/(aH))^2.    (26)

For the observable range k ~ 0.01-0.1 h/Mpc (BAO to cluster scales):

    delta_DE / delta_m ~ 10^{-7} to 10^{-9}.           (27)

This is far below the cosmic variance limit for any galaxy survey. **Direct detection of dark energy perturbations at c_s = 10c is not feasible with any planned experiment.**

### VI.B. Indirect Constraints

Current constraints on c_s come from:

1. **CMB ISW:** Consistent with c_s >= 1 at 95% CL [19]. Our prediction (c_s = 10c) is compatible.
2. **Galaxy clustering:** Consistent with c_s >= 0.1c at 95% CL [20]. Our prediction is compatible.
3. **Cluster abundance:** Consistent with c_s >= 0.01c at 95% CL [21]. Our prediction is compatible.

None of these constrain the c_s > 1 regime. The current observational situation is that c_s >> 1 and c_s = 1 are both consistent with all data.

### VI.C. Future Discriminating Observations

The most promising channels for testing c_s ~ 10c are:

**Channel 1: Euclid + Rubin combined survey.**

The combination of Euclid spectroscopic galaxy clustering and Rubin photometric weak lensing can constrain the effective dark energy perturbation parameter c_eff^2 = c_s^2 (1 + w):

    sigma(c_eff^2) ~ 5    (Euclid + Rubin Y10) [22].    (28)

Our prediction: c_eff^2 = 100 x 0.005 = 0.5. Detection at the ~0.10 sigma level — insufficient.

**Channel 2: 21cm intensity mapping at z > 2.**

SKA-era 21cm surveys probe the matter power spectrum at ultra-large scales approaching the Jeans length. For c_s = 10c:

    k_J = aH/c_s ~ H_0/(10c) ~ 2 x 10^{-5} h/Mpc.    (29)

This corresponds to angular scales of ~30 degrees at z = 2. The 21cm power spectrum would show a characteristic suppression at k < k_J relative to the c_s = infinity prediction. However, the suppression is at the 1% level ((1+w)/c_s^2 ~ 7 x 10^{-5}), likely buried by foreground contamination.

**Channel 3: Multi-messenger GW cosmology.**

Future space-based GW detectors (LISA [23], DECIGO [24], BBO [25]) combined with EM counterpart identification can constrain the dark energy medium's dispersive effect on GW propagation. The signal (24) is 10^{-32} at mHz — well beyond current technology but potentially accessible to post-LISA missions.

**Channel 4: Model-independent reconstruction.**

The most realistic path is *not* to measure c_s directly, but to establish that dark energy perturbations are undetectably small — consistent with c_s >> 1 — while simultaneously measuring w_0 != -1. The combination {w_0 = -0.993, no DE clustering} would be powerful circumstantial evidence for a superluminal sound speed.

### VI.D. Summary of Detection Feasibility

| Channel | Observable | Signal level | Threshold instrument | Feasible? |
|---------|-----------|-------------|---------------------|-----------|
| DE clustering | delta_DE/delta_m | 10^{-7}-10^{-9} | Far future | No |
| ISW cross-correlation | Null deviation | Consistent with Lambda CDM | Euclid/Rubin | Null test only |
| GW dispersion | delta v/c | 10^{-32} (mHz) | Post-LISA | No |
| 21cm ultra-large scale | P(k) suppression | ~1% at k ~ 10^{-5} | SKA Phase 2+ | Unlikely |
| Model-independent w_0 + no clustering | Combined evidence | sigma(w_0) ~ 0.005 | Euclid + Rubin + Roman | **Yes (~2032)** |

*Table 4: Detection prospects for c_s ~ 10c.*

The most realistic detection path is indirect: establish w_0 != -1 at high significance while confirming the absence of dark energy clustering, then constrain the allowed c_s range from below.

## VII. Conclusions

We have derived the sound speed of dark energy perturbations from first principles within five-dimensional self-tuning cosmology:

    c_s approx 10c,    c_s^2 approx 100.               (30)

This prediction has three notable features:

1. **It is parameter-free.** The value c_s ~ 1/sqrt(epsilon_1) is determined by the NCG Gauss-Bonnet coupling, which is a computable spectral-geometric quantity (Paper IV, Theorem 1). No free parameters are adjusted.

2. **It occupies a unique phenomenological regime.** No other dark energy model predicts c_s^2 ~ 100 from first principles. The value is qualitatively distinct from Lambda CDM (no DOF), quintessence (c_s = c), and clustering DE (c_s << c).

3. **It is falsifiable.** Any detection of dark energy clustering at scales below ~30,000 Mpc would exclude c_s > 1 and hence the Meridian framework. Conversely, establishing w_0 != -1 with no dark energy clustering would support the prediction.

The combination of predictions from Papers I-V — {w_0 = -0.993, w_a ~ +0.01, c_s ~ 10c, zeta_0 = 0.038, no phantom crossing} — forms a unique observational fingerprint for the five-dimensional self-tuning framework. Each prediction is individually testable; together they constitute a comprehensive falsification program for the framework as a whole.
